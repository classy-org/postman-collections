# Retrieve Order Items through the Transaction API

## Purpose

One-time or recurring donations made through Classy can have multiple items associated with them. These items can be used to track what the donor is contributing to. This Postman collection demonstrates how to retrieve the items, which are associated with a transaction for one-time donations or one transaction per recurring donation made in the same order.

This collection will not modify any data in your account, only retrieve information that already exists. You can utilize the Mock Server to gain understanding on how this data can be retrieved. More information on how to use the Mock Server is [further down in this README](#mock-server).

## How to use

For instructions on how to import this collection and environment variables, refer to the README.md file at the root of this repository.

Once this collection has been imported into your workspace, please refer to the documentation contained within to understand what calls to make.

## Mock Server

Along with being able to plug in your credentials to make calls to the Classy API, this collection also has a mock server that goes along with it. All you need to be able to use the mock server to make requests and get back some faked data, ensure you import and use the `Classy API Mock Server - Fetch Multi-Item Order` environment!
