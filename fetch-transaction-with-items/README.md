# Fetch Multi-Item Order

## Purpose

One-time or recurring donations made through Classy can have multiple items associated with them. These items can be used to track what the donor is contributing to. This Postman collection demonstrates how to retrieve those items which are associated with a transaction for one-time donations or a single transaction per recurring donation made in the same order.

This collection will not modify any data in your account, only retrieve information that already exists. You can utilize the Mock Server to gain an understanding of how this data can be retrieved. More information about using the Mock Server is [further down in this README](#mock-server).

## How to use

For instructions on how to import this collection and environment variables, refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/classy-org/postman-collections/blob/main/README.md#classy-api-postman-collections) file at the root of this repository.

Once this collection has been imported into your workspace, please refer to the documentation contained within the `README` to understand which calls to make.

## Mock Server

Along with being able to plug in your credentials to make calls to the Classy API, this collection also has a mock server that goes along with it. To use the mock server to make requests and get back some faked data, ensure you import and use the `Classy API Mock Server - Fetch Multi-Item Order` environment!
