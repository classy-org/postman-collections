# Retrieve Source Codes

## Purpose

A key feature of the Classy platform is allowing users to specify custom source codes to track conversions on transactions, fundraising teams, or fundraising pages. For more information on how this works, please [review this article](https://support.classy.org/s/article/source-codes). This Postman collection has examples of how to retrieve source codes associated with a specific transaction, fundraising page, or fundraising team; along with how to fetch all source codes associated with a campaign or organization's transactions, fundraising pages, and/or fundraising teams.

This collection will not modify any data in your account, only retrieve information that already exists. If you do not currently utilize source codes, no source code data will be returned. However, you can utilize the Mock Server to gain understanding on how this data can be retrieved. More information on how to use the Mock Server is [further down in this README](#mock-server).

## How to use

For instructions on how to import this collection and environment variables, refer to the README.md file at the root of this repository.

Once this collection has been imported into your workspace, please refer to the documentation contained within to understand what calls to make.

## Mock Server

Along with being able to plug in your credentials to make calls to the Classy API, this collection also has a mock server that goes along with it. All you need to be able to use the mock server to make requests and get back some faked data, ensure you import and use the `Classy API Mock Server - Fetch Source Codes` environment!
